# Project Memory: The Decosystem

> Persistent context for AI agents working on this repository.

## Architecture Decisions

- **Primary Identity**: `dicoangelo` (personal) building under `Dicoangelo` (org)
- **Brand Color**: Cyan `#00d9ff` on dark background `#0d1117`
- **Philosophy**: "Uncover, Synthesize, Build" - Sovereign infrastructure focus

## Preferences

- Minimal badge usage (avoid credential stuffing)
- Static badges preferred over dynamic APIs (reliability)
- Tables over bullet lists for structured data

## Active Goals

1. Establish credibility through linked proof-of-work (real repos)
2. Position as AI/Blockchain architect with enterprise partnership experience
3. Drive traffic to Metaventions AI platform
